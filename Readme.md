# gRPC Demo Project

# gRPC (google Remote Procedure Call)
gRPC is a modern, open source remote procedure call (RPC) framework that can run anywhere. It enables client and server applications to communicate transparently, and makes it easier to build connected systems. It Uses Proto-buff for communication.

 - Protobuf: Protobuf or Protocol Buffers is a free and open-source cross-platform data format used to serialize structured data. It is useful in developing programs to communicate with each other over a network or for storing data.

# Types of RPCs / APIs in gRPC
- Unary
- Client Streaming
- Server Streaming
- Bi-Directional Streaming
# Modules In my Project
- grpc-client-service module: Contains all the service related to client and controllers.
- grpc-server-service module: Contains all the services related to server.
- proto module: Contains all the proto file and required models and jpa repository for creating and accessing database.
